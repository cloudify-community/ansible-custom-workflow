# Ansible Custom Workflow Example

This repository provides an example of using Ansible to implement a custom day 2 workflow (patching a server).

You can use this example by uploading the blueprint archive to your Cloudify manager:

```
cfy blueprint upload -b Ansible-Custom-Workflow https://github.com/cloudify-community/ansible-custom-workflow/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```
